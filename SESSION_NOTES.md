## 📋 Current State

### Last Updated
- **Date:** 2025-01-23
- **Session:** Template Reorganization
- **Status:** ✅ Template Reorganized & Building Successfully

### What Works Right Now
- ✅ Type-safe API client (451KB generated types)
- ✅ DDD folder structure (9 domains + 6 features)
- ✅ Request domain reference implementation
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation (7 files including CHANGELOG.md)
- ✅ NPM scripts for API type generation
- ✅ TailAdmin template reorganized into DDD structure
- ✅ Build compiles successfully (3-5 seconds)
- ✅ All imports updated to new structure

### Currently Working On
- 🎯 **Next:** Start building first domain feature
- 🎯 **Next:** Consider: Authentication or Request creation flow

### Blocked/Waiting
- ⏸️ None currently

---

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps

1. **Define route structure** - Map URLs to features
2. **Pick first feature** - Start with one domain (Requests? Menus?)
3. **Build authentication** - Login/session management
4. **Implement RBAC** - Permission system

## 📚 Quick Context for Next Session

### Architecture Decisions Made

1. **DDD with Vertical Slices**
   - Organized by domain (requests, offers, orders)
   - Each domain is self-contained
   - Cross-domain features go in `features/`

2. **Type-Safe API Integration**
   - Auto-generated from OpenAPI spec
   - Regenerates in 130ms with `npm run api:update`
   - Located in `src/lib/api/`

3. **Reference Implementation**
   - Request domain fully implemented as example
   - Location: `src/components/domains/requests/`
   - Copy this pattern for other domains

4. **Import Rules**
   - Always use domain public APIs (via `index.ts`)
   - No cross-domain imports (use features instead)
   - Follow dependency direction (top → down)

### NPM Scripts

```bash
npm run dev              # Start development

## 📝 Session History

### Session 1 - 2025-10-23 - Foundation Setup

**Goals:**
- ✅ Set up type-safe API client
- ✅ Create DDD folder structure
- ✅ Build reference implementation
- ✅ Write comprehensive docs

**What We Built:**
- Type-safe API client with 451KB of generated types
- 9 domain folders with consistent structure
- Request domain reference implementation
- 6 documentation files (~15,000 words)
- NPM scripts for API type generation
- ESLint rules for DDD patterns

**Decisions Made:**
- **DDD Organization:** Chose vertical slices over horizontal layers
  - *Why:* Easier to understand business logic, better for one-person team
- **Auto-Generated Types:** Using openapi-typescript
  - *Why:* Always in sync with backend, regenerates in 130ms
- **Request as Reference:** Fully implemented Request domain
  - *Why:* Other developers (you!) can copy the pattern
- **Barrel Exports:** All domains export via `index.ts`
  - *Why:* Clear public API, prevents internal coupling

**Next Session Should:**
- Define route structure (customer vs caterer vs admin routes)
- Pick first feature to build
- Set up authentication/session management

**Files Created:**
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `CODING_GUIDELINES.md`
- `QUICKSTART.md`
- `FOUNDATION_COMPLETE.md`
- `SESSION_NOTES.md` (this file)
- `src/lib/api/` (complete API client)
- `src/components/domains/requests/` (reference implementation)
- `src/config/index.ts`

### Session 2 - 2025-01-23 - Template Reorganization

**Goals:**
- ✅ Define routing strategy for all user roles
- ✅ Assess project capability and feasibility
- ✅ Reorganize TailAdmin template into DDD structure
- ✅ Fix all imports and ensure build succeeds

**What We Built:**
- Complete routing strategy documentation (ROUTING_STRATEGY.md)
- Project capability assessment (CAPABILITY_ASSESSMENT.md) - 80% foundation done
- Template reorganization plan (TEMPLATE_REORGANIZATION.md)
- Reorganized 100+ components into new structure:
  - `src/components/shared/` - Reusable UI components
  - `src/components/_examples/` - Useful examples (auth, invoice, task, etc.)
  - `src/components/_template/` - Preserved template code for inspiration
- Updated 100+ import statements across entire codebase
- Fixed all relative imports to use absolute paths
- CHANGELOG.md for tracking code changes

**Decisions Made:**
- **Hybrid Approach:** Keep useful components, move examples, preserve template
  - *Why:* Best of both worlds - clean structure but template available as reference
- **Three Folders:** `shared/`, `_examples/`, `_template/`
  - *Why:* Clear separation between reusable code, examples, and unused templates
- **Absolute Imports:** Convert all relative imports to @/ imports
  - *Why:* Clearer, less brittle when files move
- **Multi-Session System:** Created comprehensive documentation system
  - *Why:* Makes it easy to resume work across many sessions

**Next Session Should:**
- Pick first feature to build (Authentication? Request creation?)
- Start implementing actual business features
- Consider setting up better Claude CLI permissions for faster execution

**Files Created/Modified:**
- Created: `ROUTING_STRATEGY.md`, `CAPABILITY_ASSESSMENT.md`, `TEMPLATE_REORGANIZATION.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`
- Modified: 100+ files with updated imports
- Reorganized: All template components into new folder structure
- Updated: `SESSION_NOTES.md` (this file)

**Build Status:**
- ✅ Webpack compilation: SUCCESS (3-5 seconds)
- ⚠️ ESLint warnings: Minor issues in API library (unused vars, `any` types) - can fix later

## 💡 Context Tips for Claude

### To Resume Efficiently

When starting a new session, tell Claude:

```
"Let's continue building Thiam Dashboard.
Please read SESSION_NOTES.md for current state.
Today we're working on: {feature name}"
```

### To Get Context on a Feature

```
"We're building {feature}.
Check SESSION_NOTES.md for architecture decisions.
Reference the Request domain pattern in src/components/domains/requests/"
```

### To Make a Decision

```
"We need to decide on {X}.
Update SESSION_NOTES.md with the decision and reasoning."
```

### When Finishing a Session

```
"Update SESSION_NOTES.md with today's progress.
What should the next session focus on?"
```

## 📌 Important Context

### API Backend
- Location: `../thiam-api/`
- Swagger: `../thiam-api/docs/swagger.yaml`
- Runs on: `http://localhost:8080`
- Start: `cd ../thiam-api && docker-compose up`

### Admin Template
- Already installed: TailAdmin Next.js template
- Location: `src/components/` (existing UI components)
- Can reuse: buttons, modals, tables, etc.

### Tech Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **State:** React Query + Zustand
- **Forms:** React Hook Form + Zod
- **Types:** TypeScript (strict mode)
- **API:** Type-safe fetch with openapi-fetch

---

## 🔑 Key Principles

1. **Type Safety First** - No `any` types, everything strictly typed
2. **Domain Boundaries** - No cross-domain imports, use features instead
3. **Public APIs** - Import from domain's `index.ts`, never internal files
4. **Pure Functions** - Utils should be side-effect free
5. **Single Responsibility** - Each file/function does ONE thing
6. **Explicit > Implicit** - Clear types, clear naming, no magic
7. **Copy the Pattern** - Use Request domain as reference for everything
