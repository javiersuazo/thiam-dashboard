# Generated API Types

This directory contains auto-generated TypeScript types from the Thiam API OpenAPI specification.

**IMPORTANT:**
- DO NOT edit `schema.ts` manually - it will be overwritten
- These files SHOULD be committed to git so all developers have consistent types
- Regenerate with: `npm run api:update`

The schema.ts file (~451KB) is committed because:
1. Ensures all developers have the same API types
2. Works offline - no need for API access during development
3. Provides instant IDE autocomplete
4. Small enough to commit (< 1MB)
