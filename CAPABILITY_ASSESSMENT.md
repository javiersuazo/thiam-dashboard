## 📊 Gap Analysis

### Critical Path to MVP

```
1. ✅ Backend API               [DONE - 70% complete]
2. ✅ Type-safe client          [DONE - 100%]
3. ✅ Architecture              [DONE - 100%]
4. ⚠️ Authentication           [TODO - 2 days]
5. ⚠️ RBAC                     [TODO - 2-3 days]
6. ⚠️ Customer features        [TODO - 1 week]
7. ⚠️ Caterer features         [TODO - 1 week]
8. ⚠️ Operations features      [TODO - 1 week]
```

**Estimate to MVP:** 4-5 weeks

### What's Blocking Us?

**Nothing major!** 🎉

The only blockers are:
1. ⚠️ Auth/Session (2 days) - Must do first
2. ⚠️ RBAC (2-3 days) - Must do second

After that, it's just building features following the pattern.

### What's Our Biggest Risk?

**Time complexity of features.**

Some features (like AI chat, real-time notifications) are complex. But:
- We can build them incrementally
- We have patterns to follow
- API supports them already

**Mitigation:** Build core features first, add advanced features later.

---

## 💪 Our Strengths

### 1. Solid Foundation ✅
- DDD architecture in place
- Type-safe API client ready
- Reference implementation exists
- Patterns documented

### 2. Backend Ready ✅
- Most API endpoints exist
- Can call them type-safely
- Event system works
- File uploads work

### 3. One-Person Optimized ✅
- Clear patterns (copy don't invent)
- Excellent docs (no guessing)
- Working examples (paste and adapt)
- Fast type generation (130ms)

### 4. Incremental Approach ✅
- Can build one feature at a time
- Can deploy partially
- Can test as we go
- Can add complexity later

### 5. Reference Pattern ✅
- Request domain fully built
- Shows exactly how to do it
- Copy-paste-adapt workflow
- Consistent structure

---

## ⚠️ Our Challenges

### 1. Scope is Large
**Reality:** You described a LOT of features.

**Mitigation:**
- Build MVP first (core flows only)
- Add features incrementally
- Prioritize by user value
- Defer nice-to-haves

### 2. Multiple User Types
**Reality:** 5 departments + 2 actors = complex RBAC

**Mitigation:**
- RBAC system is designed
- API supports it
- Build incrementally by role
- Start with one role, add others

### 3. Advanced Features Are Complex
**Reality:** AI chat, real-time features are non-trivial

**Mitigation:**
- Core features don't need them
- Build them last
- Can use libraries/services
- API already has WebSocket

### 4. You're One Person
**Reality:** This is a lot for one developer

**Mitigation:**
- You have AI help (Claude!)
- Patterns are clear
- Copy-paste workflow
- Incremental development
